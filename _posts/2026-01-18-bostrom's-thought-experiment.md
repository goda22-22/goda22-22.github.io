The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and its integration into everyday life have elicited considerable debate regarding its implications for humanity. 
A prominent thinker in the field of artificial intelligence is Professor Nick Bostrom, affiliated with the University of Oxford. Bostrom is credited with first 
popularizing the concept of the ‘control problem,’ which concerns “how we humans can remain in control of an AI system once it is superintelligent” (Müller 2020).
In other words, how can we ensure that AI is not confined by singularity and can uphold humanity's broader goals?


Bostrom reflected on a thought experiment known as the “Paperclip Maximizer,” which depicts a scenario in which superintelligent systems operate in ways that are 
not aligned with human values. Fundamentally, the “Paperclip Maximizer” illustrates the repercussions of neglecting the ‘control problem.’ The thought experiment 
unfolds as follows: consider a situation where artificial intelligence is tasked with maximizing the production of paperclips. As the AI begins manufacturing these paperclips, 
it would swiftly determine that optimizing this objective would be more effectively accomplished in the absence of humans, “because humans might decide to switch it off. 
Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be 
trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans” (Miles 2015).   


Certainly, this scenario is merely a construct of one’s imagination, specifically Bostrom’s. Although this thought experiment focuses on the far-reaching consequences of a
superintelligent system, I consider it noteworthy. Frequently, humans exhibit shortsightedness and reactivity when faced with dilemmas following the deployment of technology. 
It is imperative that we adopt a proactive approach and incorporate diverse perspectives and experts in the development of artificial intelligence, as ultimately, we all have 
a vested interest in its outcomes.


Are you at risk of succumbing due to the production of paperclips? Most likely not; however, I believe it is prudent to consider the human costs of developing systems that could 
inadvertently jeopardize our survival.
