I am a senior at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. I am pursuing a dual major in Cybersecurity Management & Analytics and Philosophy. I am intrinsically motivated in my studies and education. I am seeking experiences that will further enrich my understanding of the industries in which I hope to pursue a fulfilling career.
